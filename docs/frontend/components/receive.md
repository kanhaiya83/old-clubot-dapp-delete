# `ReceivePage.tsx`

## Description
This file contains the `ReceivePage` component for the Cluster project. It serves as the main page for receiving tokens, incorporating the `ReceiveTokens` component and a navigation tab.

## Imports
- `useLocation` from `react-router-dom` for accessing the current route
- `ReceiveTokens` component for QR code generation
- `SendRecieveSwapTab` component for navigation
- `useAccount` hook from `wagmi` for accessing wallet account information

## Component: ReceivePage

### Hooks
- `useLocation()`: To get the current route path
- `useAccount()`: To access the user's wallet address and connected chain

### Main Functionality
1. Displays a tab navigation for Send/Receive/Swap actions
2. Renders the `ReceiveTokens` component with the user's wallet address and chain information
3. Provides a layout structure for the receive page

### Render
Returns a section containing:
- `SendRecieveSwapTab` component for navigation
- A container div with styling and overflow handling
- A header "Receive Tokens"
- `ReceiveTokens` component with props for address, chain, and a sample function call

## Key Features
- Integrates wallet connection data into the receive functionality
- Provides a consistent layout and navigation for the receive page
- Demonstrates the use of a sample function call in the QR code generation

## Usage Example
```jsx
import ReceivePage from './pages/ReceivePage';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other components */}
      <ReceivePage />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Related Components
- `ReceiveTokens`: The main component for generating and displaying the QR code
- `SendRecieveSwapTab`: Navigation component for switching between send, receive, and swap functionalities

## Notes
- The component uses a sample function call (`transfer`) in the `ReceiveTokens` props. This should be adjusted based on the actual requirements of the application.
- The layout includes responsive design considerations with different styling for mobile and desktop views.

This `ReceivePage` component serves as a wrapper for the token receiving functionality in the Cluster project. It provides a consistent user interface and integrates the necessary wallet information for generating receive QR codes. The inclusion of a navigation tab suggests that this page is part of a larger set of related functionalities (likely including send and swap options) within the application.
